# Get started with Tensorflow Data Validation

Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) can analyze training and serving data to:

*   compute descriptive
    [statistics](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto),

*   infer a
    [schema](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto),

*   detect
    [data anomalies](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/anomalies.proto).

The core API supports each piece of functionality, with convenience methods that
build on top and can be called in the context of notebooks.

## Computing descriptive data statistics

TFDV can compute descriptive
[statistics](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto)
that provide a quick overview of the data in terms of the features that are
present and the shapes of their value distributions. Tools such as
[Facets Overview](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) can provide a succinct
visualization of these statistics for easy browsing.

For example, suppose that `path` points to a file in the `TFRecord` format
(which holds records of type `tensorflow.Example`). The following snippet
illustrates the computation of statistics using TFDV:

```python
    stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(data_location=path)
```

The returned value is a
[DatasetFeatureStatisticsList](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto)
protocol buffer. The [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/tutorials/data_validation/tfdv_basic.ipynb)
contains a visualization of the statistics using
[Facets Overview](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/):

```python
    tfdv.visualize_statistics(stats)
```

![Screenshot of statistics visualization](images/stats.png)

The previous example assumes that the data is stored in a `TFRecord` file. TFDV
also supports CSV input format, with extensibility for other common formats.
You can find the available data decoders [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/tree/master/tensorflow_data_validation/coders).
In addition, TFDV provides the `tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe` utility
function for users with in-memory data represented as a pandas DataFrame.

In addition to computing a default set of data statistics, TFDV can also
compute statistics for semantic domains (e.g., images, text). To enable
computation of semantic domain statistics, pass a [tfdv.StatsOptions](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/blob/master/tensorflow_data_validation/statistics/stats_options.py)
object with `enable_semantic_domain_stats` set to True to
`tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord`.

### Running on Google Cloud

Internally, TFDV uses [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org)'s data-parallel
processing framework to scale the computation of statistics over large datasets.
For applications that wish to integrate deeper with TFDV (e.g. attach statistics
generation at the end of a data-generation pipeline,
[generate statistics for data in custom format](#writing-custom-data-connector)),
the API also exposes a Beam PTransform for statistics generation.

To run TFDV on Google Cloud, the TFDV wheel file must be downloaded and provided
to the Dataflow workers. Download the wheel file to the current directory as
follows:

```sh
pip download tensorflow_data_validation \
  --no-deps \
  --platform manylinux1_x86_64 \
  --only-binary=:all:

```

The following snippet shows an example usage of TFDV on Google Cloud:

```python

import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions, GoogleCloudOptions, StandardOptions, SetupOptions

PROJECT_ID = ''
JOB_NAME = ''
GCS_STAGING_LOCATION = ''
GCS_TMP_LOCATION = ''
GCS_DATA_LOCATION = ''
# GCS_STATS_OUTPUT_PATH is the file path to which to output the data statistics
# result.
GCS_STATS_OUTPUT_PATH = ''

PATH_TO_WHL_FILE = ''


# Create and set your PipelineOptions.
options = PipelineOptions()

# For Cloud execution, set the Cloud Platform project, job_name,
# staging location, temp_location and specify DataflowRunner.
google_cloud_options = options.view_as(GoogleCloudOptions)
google_cloud_options.project = PROJECT_ID
google_cloud_options.job_name = JOB_NAME
google_cloud_options.staging_location = GCS_STAGING_LOCATION
google_cloud_options.temp_location = GCS_TMP_LOCATION
options.view_as(StandardOptions).runner = 'DataflowRunner'

setup_options = options.view_as(SetupOptions)
# PATH_TO_WHL_FILE should point to the downloaded tfdv wheel file.
setup_options.extra_packages = [PATH_TO_WHL_FILE]

tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(GCS_DATA_LOCATION,
                                       output_path=GCS_STATS_OUTPUT_PATH,
                                       pipeline_options=options)

```

In this case, the generated statistics proto is stored in a TFRecord file
written to `GCS_STATS_OUTPUT_PATH`.

NOTE When calling any of the `tfdv.generate_statistics_...` functions (e.g.,
`tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord`) on Google Cloud, you must provide an
`output_path`. Specifying None may cause an error.

## Inferring a schema over the data

The
[schema](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto)
describes the expected properties of the data. Some of these properties are:

*   which features are expected to be present
*   their type
*   the number of values for a feature in each example
*   the presence of each feature across all examples
*   the expected domains of features.

In short, the schema describes the expectations for "correct" data and can thus
be used to detect errors in the data (described below). Moreover, the same
schema can be used to set up
[Tensorflow Transform](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform) for data
transformations. Note that the schema is expected to be fairly static, e.g.,
several datasets can conform to the same schema, whereas statistics (described
above) can vary per dataset.

Since writing a schema can be a tedious task, especially for datasets with lots
of features, TFDV provides a method to generate an initial version of the schema
based on the descriptive statistics:

```python
    schema = tfdv.infer_schema(stats)
```

In general, TFDV uses conservative heuristics to infer stable data properties
from the statistics in order to avoid overfitting the schema to the specific
dataset. It is strongly advised to **review the inferred schema and refine
it as needed**, to capture any domain knowledge about the data that TFDV's
heuristics might have missed.

By default, `tfdv.infer_schema` infers the shape of each required feature, if
`value_count.min` equals `value_count.max` for the feature. Set the
`infer_feature_shape` argument to False to disable shape inference.

The schema itself is stored as a
[Schema protocol buffer](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto)
and can thus be updated/edited using the standard protocol-buffer API. TFDV also
provides a [few utility methods](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/tree/master/tensorflow_data_validation/utils/schema_util.py)
 to make these updates easier. For instance,
suppose that the schema contains the following stanza to describe a required
string feature `payment_type` that takes a single value:

```json
feature {
  name: "payment_type"
  value_count {
    min: 1
    max: 1
  }
  type: BYTES
  domain: "payment_type"
  presence {
    min_fraction: 1.0
    min_count: 1
  }
}
```

To mark that the feature should be populated in at least 50% of the examples:

```python
    tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'payment_type').presence.min_fraction = 0.5
```

The [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/tutorials/data_validation/tfdv_basic.ipynb)
contains a simple visualization of the
schema as a table, listing each feature and its main characteristics as encoded
in the schema.

![Screenshot of schema visualization](images/schema.png)


## Checking the data for errors

Given a schema, it is possible to check whether a dataset conforms to the
expectations set in the schema or whether there exist any [data anomalies]
(https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/blob/master/g3doc/anomalies.md).
You can check your data for errors (a) in the aggregate across an entire dataset
by matching the statistics of the dataset against the schema, or (b) by checking
for errors on a per-example basis.

### Matching the statistics of the dataset against a schema

To check for errors in the aggregate, TFDV matches the statistics of the dataset
against the schema and marks any discrepancies. For example:

```python
    # Assume that other_path points to another TFRecord file
    other_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(data_location=other_path)
    anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(statistics=other_stats, schema=schema)
```

The result is an instance of the
[Anomalies](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/anomalies.proto)
protocol buffer and describes any errors where the statistics do not agree with
the schema. For example, suppose that the data at `other_path` contains examples
with values for the feature `payment_type` outside the domain specified in the
schema.

This produces an anomaly

```python
   payment_type  Unexpected string values  Examples contain values missing from the schema: Prcard (<1%).
```

indicating that an out of domain value was found in the stats in < 1% of
the feature values.

If this was expected, then the schema can be updated as follows:

```python
   tfdv.get_domain(schema, 'payment_type').value.append('Prcard')
```

If the anomaly truly indicates a data error, then the underlying data should be
fixed before using it for training.

The various anomaly types that can be detected by this module are listed [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/anomalies.proto).

The [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/tutorials/data_validation/tfdv_basic.ipynb)
contains a simple visualization of the anomalies as
a table, listing the features where errors are detected and a short description
of each error.

![Screenshot of anomalies](images/anomaly.png)

### Checking for errors on a per-example basis

TFDV also provides the option to validate data on a per-example basis, instead
of comparing dataset-wide statistics against the schema. TFDV provides functions
for validating data on a per-example basis and then generating summary
statistics for the anomalous examples found. For example:

```python
   options = tfdv.StatsOptions(schema=schema)
   anomalous_example_stats = tfdv.validate_examples_in_tfrecord(
       data_location=input, stats_options=options)
```

The `anomalous_example_stats` that `validate_examples_in_tfrecord` returns is
a [DatasetFeatureStatisticsList](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto)
protocol buffer in which each dataset consists of the set of examples that
exhibit a particular anomaly. You can use this to determine the number of
examples in your dataset that exhibit a given anomaly and the characteristics of
those examples.

TFDV also provides the `validate_instance` function for identifying whether an
individual example exhibits anomalies when matched against a schema. To use this
function, the example must be a dict mapping feature names to numpy arrays of
feature values. You can use the the decoder in `tfx_bsl` to decode serialized
`tf.train.Example`s into this format. For example:

```python
   import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv
   import tfx_bsl
   import pyarrow as pa
   decoder = tfx_bsl.coders.example_coder.ExamplesToRecordBatchDecoder()
   example = decoder.DecodeBatch([serialized_tfexample])
   options = tfdv.StatsOptions(schema=schema)
   anomalies = tfdv.validate_instance(example, options)
```

As with `validate_statistics`, the result is an instance of the [Anomalies](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/anomalies.proto)
protocol buffer that describes any errors where the example does not agree with
the specified schema.

## Schema Environments

By default, validations assume that all datasets in a pipeline adhere to a
single schema. In some cases introducing slight schema variations is necessary,
for instance features used as labels are required during training (and should be
validated), but are missing during serving.

**Environments** can be used to express such requirements. In particular,
features in schema can be associated with a set of environments using
default_environment, in_environment and not_in_environment.

For example, if the **tips** feature is being used as the label in training, but
missing in the serving data. Without environment specified, it will show up as
an anomaly.

```python
    serving_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(data_location=serving_data_path)
    serving_anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(serving_stats, schema)
```

![Screenshot of serving anomalies](images/serving_anomaly.png)

To fix this, we need to set the default environment for all features to be both
'TRAINING' and 'SERVING', and exclude the 'tips' feature from SERVING
environment.

```python
    # All features are by default in both TRAINING and SERVING environments.
    schema.default_environment.append('TRAINING')
    schema.default_environment.append('SERVING')

    # Specify that 'tips' feature is not in SERVING environment.
    tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'tips').not_in_environment.append('SERVING')

    serving_anomalies_with_env = tfdv.validate_statistics(
        serving_stats, schema, environment='SERVING')
```

## Checking data skew and drift

In addition to checking whether a dataset conforms to the expectations set in
the schema, TFDV also provides functionalities to detect:

*   skew between training and serving data
*   drift between different days of training data

TFDV performs this check by comparing the statistics of different datasets
based on the drift/skew comparators specified in the schema. For example, to
check if there is any skew between 'payment_type' feature within training and
serving dataset:

```python
    # Assume we have already generated the statistics of training dataset, and
    # inferred a schema from it.
    serving_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(data_location=serving_data_path)
    # Add a skew comparator to schema for 'payment_type' and set the threshold
    # of L-infinity norm for triggering skew anomaly to be 0.01.
    tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'payment_type').skew_comparator.infinity_norm.threshold = 0.01
    skew_anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(
        statistics=train_stats, schema=schema, serving_statistics=serving_stats)
```

Same with checking whether a dataset conform to the expectations set in the
schema, the result is also an instance of the
[Anomalies](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/tree/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/anomalies.proto)
protocol buffer and describes any skew between the training and serving
datasets. For example, suppose the serving data contains significantly more
examples with feature `payement_type` having value `Cash`, this produces a skew
anomaly

```python
   payment_type  High L-infinity distance between serving and training  The L-infinity distance between serving and training is 0.0435984 (up to six significant digits), above the threshold 0.01. The feature value with maximum difference is: Cash
```

If the anomaly truly indicates a skew between training and serving data, then
further investigation is necessary as this could have a direct impact on model
performance.

The [example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/tutorials/data_validation/tfdv_basic.ipynb)
contains a simple example of checking for skew-based anomalies.

Detecting drift between different days of training data can be done in a similar
way

```python
    # Assume we have already generated the statistics of training dataset for
    # day 2, and inferred a schema from it.
    train_day1_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(data_location=train_day1_data_path)
    # Add a drift comparator to schema for 'payment_type' and set the threshold
    # of L-infinity norm for triggering drift anomaly to be 0.01.
    tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'payment_type').drift_comparator.infinity_norm.threshold = 0.01
    drift_anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(
        statistics=train_day2_stats, schema=schema, previous_statistics=train_day1_stats)
```

## Writing custom data connector

To compute data statistics, TFDV provides several
[convenient methods](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/tree/master/tensorflow_data_validation/utils/stats_gen_lib.py)
for handling input data in various formats (e.g. `TFRecord` of
[tf.train.Example](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Example),
CSV, etc). If your data format is not in this list, you need to write a custom
data connector for reading input data, and connect it with the TFDV core API for
computing data statistics.

The TFDV
[core API for computing data statistics](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/tree/master/tensorflow_data_validation/api/stats_api.py)
is a
[Beam PTransform](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/ptransform-style-guide/)
that takes a PCollection of batches of input examples (a batch of input examples
is represented as an [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) RecordBatch), and outputs
a PCollection containing a single `DatasetFeatureStatisticsList` protocol
buffer.

Once you have implemented the custom data connector that batches your
input examples in an Arrow RecordBatch, you need to connect it with the
`tfdv.GenerateStatistics` API for computing the data statistics. Take `TFRecord`
of `tf.train.Example`'s for example. We provide the
[DecodeTFExample](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/tree/master/tensorflow_data_validation/coders/tf_example_decoder.py)
data connector, and below is an example of how to connect it with the
`tfdv.GenerateStatistics` API.

```python
import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv
import apache_beam as beam
from tensorflow_metadata.proto.v0 import statistics_pb2

DATA_LOCATION = ''
OUTPUT_LOCATION = ''

with beam.Pipeline() as p:
    _ = (
    p
    # 1. Read out the examples from input files.
    | 'ReadData' >> beam.io.ReadFromTFRecord(file_pattern=DATA_LOCATION)
    # 2. Convert examples to Arrow RecordBatches, which represent example
    #    batches.
    | 'DecodeData' >> tf_example_decoder.DecodeTFExample()
    # 3. Invoke TFDV `GenerateStatistics` API to compute the data statistics.
    | 'GenerateStatistics' >> tfdv.GenerateStatistics()
    # 4. Materialize the generated data statistics.
    | 'WriteStatsOutput' >> beam.io.WriteToTFRecord(
        file_path_prefix = OUTPUT_LOCATION,
        shard_name_template='',
        coder=beam.coders.ProtoCoder(
            statistics_pb2.DatasetFeatureStatisticsList)))
```

## Computing statistics over slices of data

TFDV can be configured to compute statistics over slices of data. Slicing can be
enabled by providing slicing functions which take in an Arrow `RecordBatch` and
output a sequence of tuples of form `(slice key, record batch)`. TFDV provides
an easy way to
[generate feature value based slicing functions](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/blob/master/tensorflow_data_validation/utils/slicing_util.py#L47)
which can be provided as part of `tfdv.StatsOptions` when computing statistics.

When slicing is enabled, the output
[DatasetFeatureStatisticsList](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto#L36)
proto contains multiple
[DatasetFeatureStatistics](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto#L41)
protos, one for each slice. Each slice is identified by a unique name which is
set as the
[dataset name in the DatasetFeatureStatistics proto](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/statistics.proto#L43).
By default TFDV computes statistics for the overall dataset in addition to the
configured slices.

```python
import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv
from tensorflow_data_validation.utils import slicing_util

# Slice on country feature (i.e., every unique value of the feature).
slice_fn1 = slicing_util.get_feature_value_slicer(features={'country': None})

# Slice on the cross of country and state feature (i.e., every unique pair of
# values of the cross).
slice_fn2 = slicing_util.get_feature_value_slicer(
    features={'country': None, 'state': None})

# Slice on specific values of a feature.
slice_fn3 = slicing_util.get_feature_value_slicer(
    features={'age': [10, 50, 70]})

stats_options = tfdv.StatsOptions(
    slice_functions=[slice_fn1, slice_fn2, slice_fn3])

```
