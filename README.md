*TensorFlow Data Validation* (TFDV) is a library for exploring and validating
machine learning data. It is designed to be highly scalable
and to work well with TensorFlow and [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx).

TF Data Validation includes:

*    Scalable calculation of summary statistics of training and test data.
*    Integration with a viewer for data distributions and statistics, as well
     as faceted comparison of pairs of features ([Facets](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets))
*    Automated [data-schema](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto)
     generation to describe expectations about data
     like required values, ranges, and vocabularies
*    A schema viewer to help you inspect the schema.
*    Anomaly detection to identify [anomalies](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/blob/master/g3doc/anomalies.md),
     such as missing features,
     out-of-range values, or wrong feature types, to name a few.
*    An anomalies viewer so that you can see what features have anomalies and
     learn more in order to correct them.

For instructions on using TFDV, see the [get started guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/blob/master/g3doc/get_started.md)
and try out the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/tutorials/data_validation/tfdv_basic.ipynb).
Some of the techniques implemented in TFDV are described in a
[technical paper published in SysML'19](https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2019/doc/2019/167.pdf).


Caution: TFDV may be backwards incompatible before version 1.0.

## Installing from PyPI

The recommended way to install TFDV is using the
[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-data-validation/):

```bash
pip install tensorflow-data-validation
```

## Build with Docker

This is the recommended way to build TFDV under Linux, and is continuously
tested at Google.

### 1. Install Docker

Please first install `docker` and `docker-compose` by following the directions:
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/);
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 2. Clone the TFDV repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation
cd data-validation
```

Note that these instructions will install the latest master branch of TensorFlow
Data Validation. If you want to install a specific branch (such as a release
branch), pass `-b <branchname>` to the `git clone` command.

### 3. Build the pip package

Then, run the following at the project root:

```bash
sudo docker-compose build manylinux2010
sudo docker-compose run -e PYTHON_VERSION=${PYTHON_VERSION} manylinux2010
```
where `PYTHON_VERSION` is one of `{35, 36, 37, 38}`.

A wheel will be produced under `dist/`.

### 4. Install the pip package

```shell
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Build from source

### 1. Prerequisites

To compile and use TFDV, you need to set up some prerequisites.

#### Install NumPy

If NumPy is not installed on your system, install it now by following [these
directions](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html).

#### Install Bazel

If Bazel is not installed on your system, install it now by following [these
directions](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html).

### 2. Clone the TFDV repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation
cd data-validation
```

Note that these instructions will install the latest master branch of TensorFlow
Data Validation. If you want to install a specific branch (such as a release
branch), pass `-b <branchname>` to the `git clone` command.

### 3. Build the pip package

`TFDV` wheel is Python version dependent -- to build the pip package that
works for a specific Python version, use that Python binary to run:

```shell
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

You can find the generated `.whl` file in the `dist` subdirectory.

### 4. Install the pip package

```shell
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Supported platforms

TFDV is tested on the following 64-bit operating systems:

  * macOS 10.14.6 (Mojave) or later.
  * Ubuntu 16.04 or later.
  * Windows 7 or later.

## Notable Dependencies

TensorFlow is required.

[Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) is required; it's the way that efficient
distributed computation is supported. By default, Apache Beam runs in local
mode but can also run in distributed mode using
[Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) and other Apache
Beam
[runners](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is also required. TFDV uses Arrow to
represent data internally in order to make use of vectorized numpy functions.

## Compatible versions

The following table shows the  package versions that are
compatible with each other. This is determined by our testing framework, but
other *untested* combinations may also work.
